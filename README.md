a type of way to do the 10-fold cross validation

The document MLP model include the codes that were not written by myself, it comes from my senior fellow. This KNN file is one way of implementing the 10-fold cross-validation, and it treats the MachinLearning method called KNN(k nearest neighbors). 

On the following files, i will do different kinds of method on the same data.

The data comes from the competitions of machine learning that my senior fellows took part in last year. Because I do not know whether it can be shown in public, so for safe, i do not pull the data up to here.

And the biggest benefit for this project is recording my learning of Machine Learning.
